          <p class="intro">Â¡Hola! My name is Ciera Hernandez</p>
          <p>I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer living in an <b>EXTREMELY</b> small town called Boulevard, CA that's nestled in sunny San Diego County.</p>
          <p>I love anything to do with computers! Whether it's hardware or software, I love learning all about it.</p>

        <div class='item-double'>
          <p>Let me give you some of my background.  I've lived in California all my life, the offspring of Mexican emmigrants, and currently reside in San Diego County.</p>  
          <p>My earliest memories are of nostalgic fondness for our old white beast of a computer and playing Sim Ants, Sim Towers, and other simple games that we could afford at the time.  Later on our technology horizons expanded with the introduction of the Playstation 1, GameBoy, etc.</p>
            
          <p>When I'm not on my computer, laptop, PSP, or other tech gadget I have lying around, you can find me working on my ranch, rebuilding my vintage truck, or spending quality time with my family.</p>

          <h3>History App</h3>
          <p>I have a passion for history and believe that in order to move forward we must remember our past and learn from it.  However, many schools choose to teach history in the context of names, dates, and highlighted events without attempting to immerse the students in what life was like during our past.</p>
          <p>My history app combines museum quality pictures, historical videos, timelines, reenactments, etc., in order to immerse the user into that time.</p>
          <p>This app heavily uses Javascript in order to make full use to the openended media use.</p>

          <h3>Foster Parent App</h3>
          <p>As a Foster Parent/Resource Parent I understand how much work goes into keeping track of all the documents and records that are needed to keep the caseworkers appeased.</p>
          <p>This app not only takes pictures and scans documents, but it also applies a secure timestamp that can't be tampered with.</p>
          <p>Keep track of doctor visits, dental visits, prescriptions, paperwork in order to give prescriptions, paperwork in order to administer over-the-counter-prescriptions, pictures of injuries from the park, emails and phone calls from biological parent/caseworker, call logs, contact information of the several caseworkers that you'll be passed around to, etc.
          <p>This app was designed with C++ as this app handles a lot of data, a thing C++ excells at handling.</p>
